This project demonstrates data wrangling techniques applied to a developer survey dataset using Python and Pandas.

## What’s Included
- Duplicate detection and removal  
- Missing value analysis  
- Mode-based imputation for categorical data  
- Salary distribution analysis  

## Key Feature
Missing values in the `RemoteWork` column were imputed using the most frequent category:
> Hybrid (some remote, some in-person)

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Jupyter Notebook
